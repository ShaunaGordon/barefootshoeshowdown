title: About Xero Shoes
subtitle: An In-Depth Review
slug: xero

After four years of wearing Vibrams, I wanted to try a different kind of shoe. I wanted the barefoot experience, without both dealing with the social issues that come from going around barefoot and the price of my then-favorite minimalist shoe. So, in the spring of 2016, when I thoroughly wore out my latest pair of Vibrams, I switched to [Xero Shoes.](http://xeroshoes.com/go/showdown). Specifically, I got the 4mm Connect DIY kit. After several months of wearing them *everywhere*, I've got enough data on them to start providing a review.

<!-- summary -->
# Overall Rating: <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>

I give Xero Shoes an overall rating of 4/5 Stars. These relative newcomers to the barefoot scene take it to a whole new level, but the design can take some more adapting to, and the hardcore barefooting nature of the community is not for the faint of heart. These shoes are also far less forgiving to poor form, which isn't a bad thing for the shoes, but can result in a disappointing experience if the newcomer believes the shoes are at fault.

For the DIY Xeros, especially, this should be split out between the sole and the string.

The soles, even the 4mm Connect, come with a 5,000 mile warranty. Yep, that's right, five *thousand* miles. Wear through them before that and you can likely get a replacement set.

The strings, on the other hand, don't have such a warranty, but they're simply inexpensive paracord. This is a bit of a mixed blessing, because the paracord doesn't cost much, but it also means you might have to replace it once or twice before your soles wear out.

# Quality: <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star-half-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>

Quality, like longevity, should probably be broken down between the lacing and the sole.

The sole has a 5,000 mile warranty, so the company has great confidence in it lasting, especially since it far outruns the Vibram's 60-day warranty (unless you're really crazy and can somehow put on that many miles in two months). I did find that the soles of my Xeros are starting to see a fair bit of wear in the spot right below the ball of my feet, but when I contacted the company, Steve (one of the founders) was nice enough to provide some guidance on how to adjust my form, which is the most likely cause of the wear pattern I'm finding (and is also the cause of threats of blistering on my feet; see also: the Learning Curve section). The entire rest of the soles look like new.

The lacing, as already mentioned, is just nylon cord. It's durable, but expect to replace them at least once over the life of the soles. The laces only run around $3 from the Xero Shoe website, and for about $6, you can upgrade to a rubber toe post and nylon heel strap, which can add some extra durability and ease of use to the lacing system.

This is a much simpler shoe than most of the Vibram models, and as such, has far fewer points of failure. This makes quality control for Xero Shoes that much more straightforward.

For about $35 for the DIY set, you can't really beat Xero Shoes when it comes to raw price. Now, the price can go up from there, with the new Umara Z-Trail model coming in at a whopping $79.99. You can also jack up the price of the custom pair (which can top out around $55 for the shoe, itself) with the myriad of beads and other accoutrements that are available. However, for just a no-frills shoe, even the most expensive model comes in under $100, which, in my book, is a good price for a good quality shoe. Having several options for models under $50 without really sacrificing quality is icing on the cake.

Once you get the lacing right (this can be challenging if you're new to Xero Shoes and grabbed the DIY set), these shoes are so comfortable that you can barely tell you're wearing them. They do size the soles by your actual foot measurement, but are very forgiving of being off on sizing. In fact, it's better to err on the side of too large with these shoes--especially with the DIY or custom models--because you can trim the sole down, yourself. Talk about a custom fit!

Since you thread the shoes yourself in the DIY case, if the fit isn't just right, you can always adjust it. As an added bonus, once you get that perfect fit, and if you tied your ends right, you should never have to retie them!

#### Weather Experience

Let's be real, here, Xero Shoes are sandals. They are extremely versatile, but they are still sandals, nonetheless. That means it's probably not a good idea to wear them when it's 20 below zero out.

*However*, many veteran Xero Shoe wearers have found that they can wear them with no ill effect even in fairly cold weather. The body simply adjusts to its environment and you go happily on your way. The limit for this is fairly personal, though, so the only thing to do is try it and see how you fare.

What about wet weather? I actually prefer Xero Shoes to Vibrams in (warmish) wet weather. The lack of foot enclosure makes doing something like stepping in a puddle as much of a non-issue in Xero Shoes as it is when barefoot entirely. The extra covering offered by Vibrams stays wet relatively longer, resulting in a less than pleasant experience in those conditions. Since skin and rubber are water resistant, though, that leaves only the strings on a pair of Xeros, and they're thin and dry quickly, too.

# Learning Curve: <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star-half-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>

How quickly can you adapt to Xero Shoes? Well...it depends.

If you're used to, say, unlaced Chucks, then you'll probably get used to the huaraches style that Xero Shoes commonly take on, which is a fairly loose fit. If you're used to a snug fit of cross trainers--or the glove-like fit of Vibrams--then you're going to be in for a bit longer adjustment period as you constantly feel like your shoes are going to fall off.

Don't worry, though, if you've got the tension right, they won't fall off, even if they do feel like it. I went through that, though, and even ran in them a little to get my brain to actually believe that I wasn't going to walk out of my shoes at any moment.

That's another thing that adds to the learning curve, at least for the DIY and custom models--getting the tension right. Despite how some of the pictures look, the sole is not going to be sticking to your foot. It's going to feel "floppy." That's how the huaraches style works. If you do a "thong" tying style (where a string goes between your inner two toes), you shouldn't be able to feel the string. Unlike the thong in a pair of flip flops, the thong on huaraches isn't the only thing keeping your foot on the sole and is just there to anchor the rest of the string setup.

Finally, Xero Shoes are far less forgiving of bad form than even Vibrams. This is not a bad thing, by any stretch, but a typical consumer might blame the shoe for any problems they uncover, instead of looking at their own form. If you find yourself in pain in any way while walking or running in Xero Shoes, it's very likely that you need to tweak your form to handle being barefoot. It may even be a good idea to do a couple of short sessions *actually* barefoot in order to get the more immediate environmental feedback to make form adjustments. This is by far probably the hardest part about these shoes, but also *the* most valuable.

Have you ever seen these pin impression boards?

That is the easiest way to describe the groundfeel of Xero Shoes with the 4mm Connect FeelTrue soles. Everything you step on gets transmitted through the sole and makes even Vibrams feel like wearing thick wrappings in comparison. If the shoes were televisions, Vibrams would a standard definition TV, while Xero Shoes are the new, super-high-definition 4k OLED screens.

The texture of the sidewalk, the individual stones in a gravel driveway, Xeros can feel it all in a way that only barefoot entirely can top.

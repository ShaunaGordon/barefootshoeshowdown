title: About Vibram Five Finger Shoes
subtitle: An In-Depth Review
slug: vibram

Four years ago, I picked up my very first pair of Vibram Five Fingers shoes -- a pair of [KSO TrekSports](http://amzn.to/1SytFhO). I absolutely loved them and wore them everywhere, including to work when my work environment allowed for it. I even picked up a pair of [Treksports](http://amzn.to/1pm4CRy) for indoor training. Two years later, I snagged a pair of [Lontras](http://amzn.to/1qFqGYm), the insulated winter shoes, so I could wear them year-round. About that same time, I was in need of a new pair of "summer" Vibrams, so I picked up the [Bikila LS](http://amzn.to/1Syu9o1) model, and proceeded to walk through them. Twice. After four years, and at least as many pairs, I've finally decided to write a thorough review on them.

I give Vibram Five Fingers an overall rating of 4/5 Stars. These shoes, beloved by Tough Mudders and barefoot enthusiasts the world over, are, overall, a pretty solid shoe to go with. Their bold style is guaranteed to be a conversation starter, they're built to fit literally like a glove, and their variety allows you to have pairs for nearly any occasion (especially if you can get your hands on the elusive models that are or appear to be made of leather or can otherwise pass for a more "professional" shoe). Vibram does seem to suffer from a couple of issues, however, that might make it less appealing to some people, especially those who need something more durable.

I have actually bought more than half a dozen pairs of Vibrams in the past four years, though not all of them were for my use. One thing I noticed was that their quality varied quite wildly, despite all having been purchased either directly from the Vibram Five Fingers website, or through an authorized dealer. Upon doing some internet searching, I found that this is a common complaint, and possibly due to the different Quality Assurance methods in different manufacturing/assembly locations. As a result, some of the shoes I bought lasted me for well over a year, while others started falling apart within a few months.

The common point of failure in the shoes I had purchased were where the upper was attached to the sole. In more than one pair, the toe bumpers were the first and most likely to start peeling away. This happened espcially with the TrekSports and the second pair of KSO TrekSports, though the Lontra and Bikila LS models haven't suffered the same fate. I suspect it may have to do with the difference in design and materials between the models.

This is where I've been the most disappointed in the Vibram Five Finger shoes. I've consistently worn through the soles of every model I've worn, save for the Lontras (due to wearing only in the winter, so it doesn't suffer the wear and tear of dry sidewalks) and TrekSports (which fell apart entirely), within a year. According to my Fitbit, I average about 900 miles, total, per year. That's all activities, including going for walks outdoors, walking around inside as part of everyday movement, and walking on the smooth surfaces of the inside of malls and grocery stores. That's really not a lot, compared to a lot of people. My last pair of shoes (the Bikila LS), had a hole in each sole at the ball of the foot large enough that my skin was rubbing on the concrete. The last walk on which I wore them, I had to take them off and go barefoot the last quarter of a mile back to my house, because of the concentrated wear on that spot of my foot.

The average lifespan of my Vibrams, then, was 12-18 months, or about 900 miles. For a shoe with an average price point of $100, I would expect better longevity. I would expect better longevity from the great Vibram shoe company, who rose to fame with their premium work soles.

Full disclosure -- I've historically been hard on my shoes. Prior to switching to Vibrams, it wasn't uncommon for me to wear through tennis shoes in about a year. Tennis shoes, of course, were more forgiving in longevity, due to the extra cushioning. Wearing through Vibrams in about a year, then was par for the course for me, until I found minimalist shoes that proved to have better longevity, without sacrificing the barefoot feel. So, while I would likely have rated them higher in the past, particularly when they were first pioneering the barefoot shoe, I would have expected one of the top sole manufacturers to innovate more with their new signature shoe.

Like the longevity, I would be more impressed with the price point had the competition in the minimalist shoe market come out with longer-lasting shoes for cheaper. I'm not the type to blink at a $100 pair of quality shoes, so that being the average price for Vibrams (some models are as low at $60, while some go upwards of $150) isn't surprising to me. Cyber Monday sales also help to bring the price down on select models, making them a decent buy for their current quality and longevity.

# Comfort: <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star-half-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>

By and large, Vibrams are among my favorite shoe as far as comfort goes...if you get the right size and model for your foot. Due to their design, their sizing is a lot more sensitive, and being off in sizing is a lot less forgiving than typical shoes. Where Vibram loses part of a star is in the lack of consistency of fit in sizes. I wear a 42 in the Bikila LS and they fit like a glove, but my TrekSports suffered from being either a little too large or a little too small, neither of which were particularly comfortable compared to what they should have been. I highly recommend going with a model like the Bikila LS, which has the "quick lace" system, as well as a more flexible fabric upper, which combine to make it quite a bit more comfortable than its stiffer, velcro predecessors.

The Lontras are also quite comfortable, especially when paired with the [Injiji toe socks](http://amzn.to/1pmbFtv). Since they're water resistant, they seal pretty tight, keeping the snow out and your feet quite warm in the winter time.

#### Weather Experience

One of the biggest questions I get asked is how Vibrams do in cold and wet weather. The short answer is "surprisingly well."

Even the standard ones with full-foot fabric, which aren't water resistant, do fairly well in the cold, as long as it's a dry cold. They insulate in much the same way stockings or leggings insulate, with the layer of fabric that expands the body's natural "air insulation." However, since these models are, by design, not water resistant, cold and wet together make for a less than pleasant experience. Dry cold, though? You can easily wear them to around 20&deg; Fahrenheit without getting overly cold. (Models with minimal covering, such as the [Vi-S](http://amzn.to/1VnJzfs) will, of course, not be able to go as cold, since your feet are not covered much at all.)

Cold and wet is where the Lontras and other newer water resistant and insulated models come in. The waterproofing allows the Lontras to be worn in snow and slushy conditions, as well as slightly colder dry conditions. They can be worn in even colder with the inclusion of the Injinji socks. I've worn them in weather as cold around 0&deg; Fahrenheit with little issue in dry weather, though that cold and wet start pushing the shoe's limits.
